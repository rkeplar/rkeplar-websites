                <p class="paragraph">
                    I completed two courses, one for HTML and one
                    for CSS on Codecademy to build this site.
                    First, every html page begins with the following 
                    code:

                    <p class="paragraph">
                        !DOCTYPE html>
                        html lang="en">
                        head>
                        link href="CSS STYLE SHEET" rel="stylesheet" media="screen">
                         title>TITLE HERE title>
                          /head>
                    </p>
                    <p class="paragraph"> This sets the coding language as html, the language to
                    english, links the html page to the CSS page, which is more
                    for design, and sets a title that will appear on your computer
                    tab when you are on the page. 
                </p>

                </p>

                <p class="paragraph">
                    The next step is to create the body of the webpage,
                    everything you can interact with will be within the 
                    body> tags. You may want a title or header for the 
                    page itself. Using "h1" or "h2" will make the font larger
                    and position it seperate from other text on the page.
            
                 </p>

                    <p class="paragraph">
                        For the main words of the page, what you are reading now,
                        they begin with "p". All of the coding language I have used 
                        so far needs to be enclosed in <> for it to work as code.
                    </p>
                    <p class="paragraph">
                        To change the font size or color, as I have done here, one will
                        typically use CSS. CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets
                        and is a way to make websites prettier than the standard
                        white background and black text an html page generates. To 
                        incorporate CSS, we need to give our HTML codes properties.
                        This means that inside the brackets of "h1", I wil put 
                        "h1 class = headerTwo"  to create the title at the top of 
                        each page. To make the text yellow, i set each "p" to "p class 
                        = "paragraph"" Then, on my linked CSS document, I entered ".paragraph" 
                        or ".headerTwo" and added in what I wanted it to look like.

                    </p>

                    <P class="paragraph">
                        It is not as easy as it may seem because
                        sometimes the properties may overlap, and only one will
                        show. For example,
                    </P>
                    <p class="paragraph">
                        To make the daisies in the background, I added a 
                        class property, ".container" to the opening body tag.
                        Then in CSS, I used background.image to link the url 
                        for the picture of daisies. 
            
                    </p>
                    <p class="paragraph">
                        It was hard to see the text over the background picture,
                        so after the body tag I created a div>. Div is division, it
                        means you can have a seperate style for the block of code 
                        within the div tags and it will be seperated from the rest of
                        the webpage. Within the div tag I added a class, and set 
                        the background color to be purple, our favorite color. 
                        For colors, you can either
                        type in the name of the color you want, or choose from a 
                        spectrum that will display like: rgb (120 10 5) or whichever
                        color is chosen. That is the percent of each color to 
                        show where on the spectrum it is found. I used that for 
                        the font color as I tried to match it to Daisy's tan patch
                        over her eye. Daisy actually got her name from that since 
                        she is white with a little golden patch like the flower.
                        The two different background colors overlapped, leaving only one.
                        So for one, I created an 'id' property which will override the 
                        daisy background allowing for both to be featured.
                    </p>
                    <p class="paragraph">
                        The most challenging part of building the website
                        was the multitude of tabs that I had to make. Every tab 
                        from the naviagatin menu, about us, adventures, and gallery, to 
                        the story pages you arrive at after clicking the pictures
                        in the "Adventures" tab, to the tabs in the personal
                        portfolio section had to be individually made. Each one 
                        starts with the "Doctype" and all code has to be rewritten
                        and altered for that page. It was very time consuming to do,
                        but it is good practice. After the HTML framework is set, 
                        then I get to design it in CSS which was fun to do afterwards.

                    </p>
                    <p class="paragraph"> 
                        Another challenge I have yet to overcome was with the gallery.
                        Webpages are set up as block grids, so each picture is 
                        meant to have its own block. But when the picture sizes 
                        are different, it displays awkwardly. I am still learning
                        how to resize the pictures so they display in one page
                        instead of scrolling. So, while I would have rather had 
                        that section looking perfect, it shows that I still have
                        much to learn and will continue to work on this site as 
                        I do so.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Finally, 
                    </p>
