            Each and every time I take Daisy outside,
            she makes a beeline to the car. She takes 
            off at full speed and makes me sprint after 
            her clutching the leash! She will run in the
            grass along the line of cars until she sniffs
            our car and will wait patiently - or not so 
            patiently- at the door. It's like she found the 
            prize at the bottom of the cereal box, and if that
            day isn't a car ride day but a walk-around-the 
            -neighborhood day, she will trot away for the walk
            very proud that she found the car.

        <p class="paragraph">
            But car ride days are always her favorite days.
        </p>

        <p class="paragraph">
            She loves to stick her head out the window and feel
            the air, and on busier streets she likes to take turns
            watching out every window to get the best angle from
            which to watch the city sweep by.
        </p>
        <p class="paragraph">
            She knows the car ride will take her to somewhere 
            new to explore. A place yet unsniffed. Will it be 
            the nature preserve? The quiet neighborhood park?
            A trip to Mom and Dad's? Road trip? Sometimes I'll
            take her along for the drive to the store, and while
            she would rather come inside the store with me, she 
            is always happy to see me come back with treats and 
            her favorite snacks.
        </p>

        <p class="paragraph">
            Daisy reminds me to get excited about the little things 
            in life. She reminds me to drive with my windows down 
            and feel the breeze every so often. To get excited that
            I have another day where I get to drive, get to walk,
            get to explore. To stop and appreciate the life and its beauty.

            This semester has been crazy. Working a full time job as well
            as being a research assistant and gaining an internship at
            a place I've always aspired to work at - it feels like I 
            have no time to myself to relax. But taking a moment to 
            breathe, to feel alive, to watch the sun set and sun rise, 
            there is beauty in every thing even if it is a routine. 
            Perhaps even more so if it is routine as you can always
            count on it to be there. It is the little moments that help
            keep people grounded and motivated to also keep going no matter 
            how tough things may seem.
