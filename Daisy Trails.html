            <p class="paragraph">
                Daisy adores the outdoors, she is always ready
                for a walk no matter how long she has been
                playing outside.
            </p>
            <p class="paragraph">
                While my parents have a yard she can run all 
                around in, I live in an apartment. Instead, I try to take her
                on hour long walks every day unless it is raining 
                badly, she is scared of storms.
            </p>
            <p class="paragraph">
                There are beautiful trails that run alongside
                the white river behind where I live. There are 
                many access points to the water, many of which are
                overgrown and secluded. Daisy loves these little coves.
                She loves to splash in the water and roll around in the 
                grass. She becomes a very muddy puppy very quickly.
                She does her runs alongside the hill and army crawls
                over thick vegetation.
            </p>
            <p class="paragraph">
                Along the rest of the trails, she sniffs around and 
                looks back at me and smiles as she pulls me forward. 
                Luckily, she doesn't have any interest in wild animals 
                so she never tries to catch or chase after anything. 
            </p>
            <p class="paragraph">
                She waits patiently as I take nature photos, but presses
                forward with the hike if she catches me taking photos of her. 
                We quickly learned Daisy has a 7th sense for knowing if her
                photo is being taken and that she does not particularly
                care for modelling. 
            
            </p>
            <p class="paragraph">
                At the end of the hike Daisy still has the energy to run 
                up the flights of stairs to my apartment and wait patiently
                for me to open the door. She'll get a few good sips of water
                before curling up next to me for a nap. Unless she got muddy 
                and is need of a bath - but that is a story for another page.
